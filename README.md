# CNRL

A side project I'm working on, decrypting files and exporting them to a usable/editable form ripped directly from CNRL itself.

## Notes

For the uMod Avatar Borders make sure to have the default one selected in-game, same with banners.

It takes time converting everything so I included the raw UPK files if you can't wait for me and want to do it yourself.

## To-Do List

- Finish uploading all decrypted & organized Assets.
- Finish organizing the Graphic Effects folder (There are thousands, I'm lazy so this may take time).
- Work on uMod ready files for direct use in normal RL.
- Debate to myself whether or not to add back the decrypted UPK's even though they are huge file sizes.
