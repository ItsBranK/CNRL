# CNRL

A side project I'm working on, decrypting files and exporting them to a usable/editable form ripped directly from CNRL itself.

## Notes

I don't plan on uploading the official sound track, there's no new or different songs anyway.

## To-Do List

- Finish uploading all decrypted & organized Assets.
- Finish organizing the Graphic Effects folder (There are thousands, I'm lazy so this may take time).
- Work on uMod ready files for direct use in normal RL.

## Contact
If you notice any problems or have a suggestion feel free to message me on Discord, I also hang out in the BakkesMod Discord server.
